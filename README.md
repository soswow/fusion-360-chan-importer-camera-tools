# Fusion 360 addin for "importing" CHAN camera information and other camera tools

One way to use it is in conjuction with results of photogrammetry. You can export model, cameras and transformed images from Metashape, for example, and then able to place a canvas background image on top of your model inside Fusion 360. See video below for tutorial and demonstration.

## Tutorial and demonstration

TBD

## Installation

I believe you just download `CHAN importer and camera tools` folder into `AddIns` folder of your Fusion. At the time of writing, their docs says it is over here:

* Windows – `%appdata%\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion\API\AddIns`
* Mac – `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Autodesk/Autodesk Fusion/API/AddIns`
